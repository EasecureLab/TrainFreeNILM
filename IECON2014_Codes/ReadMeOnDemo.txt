============== Description of the codes ================

EV_Demo.m  
      The demo file showing how to use the proposed algorithm to estimate the electric vehicle charging load day by day for low sampling data (sampled at 1 sample/minute)

estEV.m
      The core code of the proposed algorithm

Other files are needed functions used by estEV.
